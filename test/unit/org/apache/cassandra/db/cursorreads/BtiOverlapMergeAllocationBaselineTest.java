/**
 * The {@link OverlapMergeAllocationBaselineTest} scenarios under the BTI format, so M2.4's
 * before/after comparison has baselines for both formats (M2.1's merge core is
 * format-independent, but per-leg constants differ — BTI legs pay the partition-index lookup
 * and, on sliced shapes, run M1's seek machinery). The scenarios' reads are full-partition, so
 * no row-index seek engages and the overlap-merge cost being baselined is the same shape as
 * under BIG.
